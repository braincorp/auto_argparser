# Brain-Utils

Here we can put common utilities that do not justify a package of their own.  

Note: We only depend on extremely common or lightweight python package dependencies here, like
- Numpy 
- Attrs

We do not include more "heavy" packages like 
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

Code using more heavy packages can go in display_utils
